This project includes tasks in addressing several problems concerning the diffrent data structures in python. they are explained below
Python data structures refer to the way data is organized and stored in memory in a Python program. There are four main built-in data structures in Python: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

1. Lists: Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any type. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after they are created.

2. Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after they are created.

3. Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are mutable, and their contents can be changed after they are created.

4. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable, and their contents can be changed after they are created.

Python also has several other data structures that are not built-in, but can be imported from modules such as arrays, deque, and namedtuples. Understanding these data structures is important for efficient programming in Python.
